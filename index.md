# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Lazaro Ponce and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

Lab 1 was my favorite lab because this lab would be the start of my computer science journey. In this lab I had to write a code that outputted “Hello World!” along with anything else we wanted to write in the code. This would be the first time that I’ve ever written code, and it’s important to me because it’s something that I have been looking forward to since I decided to major in computer science.

* Lab 4

Lab 4 part 2 was another one of my favorite labs because in this lab I was able to write code that created a high/low guessing game. This lab was exciting to me, especially because I’ve become interested in code that has to do with games, and it’s interesting to see how they’re made instead of just playing them. This was one of the labs that I took my time on and went into a deeper understanding of what was happening in the code because in the future I might want to be able to make my own game starting with something small like this high/low guessing game.

* Lab 6

Lab 6 part 2 was another one of my favorite labs because in this lab I was able to understand how the game “Blackjack” can be written to play on a computer. This lab allowed me to write many functions in code in order to set rules when specific cards are played, like face cards and aces. Again, as I’ve said before, this lab is interesting to me because it goes into making games, but also it’s more complex, which helps me understand that modern games are much more complex than this code.
